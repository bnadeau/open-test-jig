# Open Test Jig

An open source test jig for electronics manufacturing. At the moment, this is far from the test jig that this project might become, but we can start somewhere. Baby steps!

## Acknowledgements ###

This project is not directly forked from another repository, but it was originally based on [Blinkinlabs's test jig](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape).
